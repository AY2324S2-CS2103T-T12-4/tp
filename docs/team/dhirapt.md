### Project: PayBack

PayBack is comprehensive tool designed to streamline one's employee information management process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `/add` command
    * What it does: Allows users to add new employee to the system.
    * Justification: This feature is essential as it allows users to efficiently add new employees to the system, thereby improving the application's usability and user experience. It meets the need for a quick and flexible way to add new employees to the system.
    * Highlights: This feature is pivotal and necessitates modifications to both the Person class and the system's storage structure. Additionally, adjustments are needed in existing commands to accommodate the new functionality. The proper functioning of other commands relies on the successful implementation of this feature.

* **New Feature**: `/transaction` command
    * What it does: Allows users to add a new transaction for a specified employee to the system.
    * Justification: This feature serves as the central purpose of the application as it allows users to keep track of transactions made by employees. It is essential for the application to serve its primary function of managing employee transactions.
    * Highlights: This feature requires the creation of a new Transaction class and the integration of this class with the existing system. The implementation of this feature is crucial for the application to function as intended.
