### Project: PayBack

PayBack is comprehensive tool designed to streamline one's employee information management process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `/edit` command
    * What it does: allows the user to update all employee's information. Specific tag related to the employee can be updated by entering tag index.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can change any particular tag they like instead of rewriting all tags.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: `/tag` command
  * What it does: allows the user to add tags to employees.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can change add multiple tags to employees and `/tag` ensures no duplicates present.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
