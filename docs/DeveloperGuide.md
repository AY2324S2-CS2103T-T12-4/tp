### Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `/delete 240001`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component <a name="ui-component"></a>

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component <a name="logic-component"></a>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("/delete 240001")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `/delete 240001` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PayBackParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PaybackParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PaybackParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component <a name="model-component"></a>
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the employee data i.e., all `Person` and `Transaction` objects (which are contained in `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTransactionList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of the /find command) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Transaction` objects (e.g., results of the /view command) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Transaction>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Payback`, which `Person` references. This allows `Payback` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component <a name="storage-component"></a>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both employee data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PayBackStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes <a name="common-classes"></a>

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation** <a name="implementation"></a>

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Add new employee

#### Implementation

The proposed implementation of adding a new employee is facilitated by `AddCommand` and `AddCommandParser`. The `AddCommand` class encapsulates the logic for adding a new employee, while the `AddCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the arguments and returning an `AddCommand` object.

The `AddCommand` class implements the following operations:

* `AddCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a new employee to the employee list in the `Model`.
* `AddCommand#equals(Object other)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if two `AddCommand` objects are equal.
* `AddCommand#toString()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns a string representation of the `AddCommand`.

The `AddCommandParser` class implements the following operations:

* `AddCommandParser#parse(String args)`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the arguments and returns an `AddCommand` object.
* `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent(ArgumentMultimap argMultimap, Prefix... prefixes)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if the specified prefixes are present in the argument multimap.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add new employee mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Model` will be initialized with the initial employee list.

Step 2. The user executes `/add :name John Doe :phone 91234567 :email johndoe@email.com :address 12 Kent Ridge Dr :year 2024 :tag Finance` command to add a new employee with the specified details. The `AddCommandParser` will parse the arguments and return an `AddCommand` object.

Step 3. The `AddCommand` object will be executed by the `Logic` component, which will add the new employee to the employee list in the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram shows how an add new employee operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddNewEmployeeSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Similarly, how an add new employee operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddNewEmployeeSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `/add` command:

![AddNewEmployeeActivityDiagram](images/AddNewEmployeeActivityDiagram.png)

The `AddCommand` class is designed to be easily extensible. For example, if a new field is added to the `Person` class, the `AddCommand` class can be easily modified to accommodate the new field.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How `/add` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Enter all details at once.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May be overwhelming for users who are not familiar with the system.

* **Alternative 2:** Enter details one by one.
  * Pros: Provides a more guided experience.
  * Cons: May be slower for users who are comfortable with the system.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPayBack`. It extends `PayBack` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `payBackStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPayBack#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current employee state in its history.
* `VersionedPayBack#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous employee state from its history.
* `VersionedPayBack#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone employee state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPayBack()`, `Model#undoPayBack()` and `Model#redoPayBack()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPayBack` will be initialized with the initial employee state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single employee state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the employee. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitPayBack()`, causing the modified state of the employee after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `payBackStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted employee state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitPayBack()`, causing another modified employee state to be saved into the `payBackStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPayBack()`, so the employee state will not be saved into the `PayBackStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoPayBack()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous employee state, and restores the employee to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial PayBack state, then there are no previous PayBack states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoPayBack()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoPayBack()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the employee to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `payBackStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest employee state, then there are no undone PayBack states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoPayBack()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the employee, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitPayBack()`, `Model#undoPayBack()` or `Model#redoPayBack()`. Thus, the `payBackStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitPayBack()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `payBackStateList`, all employee states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire employee list.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Editing a specific tag <a name="editing-tag"></a>

#### Design considerations: <a name="design-consideration-edit-tag"></a>

**Aspect: How `/edit ID :tag TAG_INDEX NEW_TAG` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Change one specific tag at a time.
    * Pros: Most of the time people only want to change one particular tag and this implementation gives them more convenience.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and have to change original data structure of tags.

* **Alternative 2:** Remove all current tags and add new tags
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Not very user-friendly as users have to key in all tags every single time.

#### Implementation <a name="implementation-edit-tag"></a>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `/edit ID :tag TAG_INDEX NEW_TAG` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `/add NAME; PHONE; EMAIL; ADDRESS; YEAR_JOINED[; TAG]â€¦` command to add a new employee.

Step 3. The user executes `/tag ID :tag NEW_TAG` command to add tags to an existing employee.

Step 4. The user executes `/edit ID :tag TAG_INDEX NEW_TAG` command to change the name of an existing tag.

The following sequence diagram shows how an edit operation edits a specific tag for user:

![EditTagSequenceDiagram](images/EditTagSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `/edit ID :tag TAG_INDEX NEW_TAG` command:

![EditTagActivityDiagram](images/EditTagActivityDiagram.png)

### Deleting a specific employee <a name="deleting-employee"></a>

#### Implementation <a name="implementation-delete-employee"></a>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `/delete ID` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `/add NAME; PHONE; EMAIL; ADDRESS; YEAR_JOINED[; TAG]â€¦` command to add a new employee.

Step 3. The user executes `/delete ID` command to prompt confirmation message for deletion of employee.

Step 4. The user executes `Y` command to confirm deletion of employee.

The following sequence diagram shows how delete operation deletes a specific user:

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `/delete ID` followed by `Y` or `N` command:
